<h1 id="reactagent">React Agent</h1>
<p>React Agent synchronizes client-side and server-side state.  It can be included in any React project without conflict with other state management tools or REST APIs.</p>
<p>React Agent is easy to learn.</p>
<p>Here's the basic idea: the client runs 'actions' that are defined on the server-side.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">run('addUser', { user: 'Billy' })
</code></pre>
<p>These actions can be as powerful as you want -- i.e. CRUD operations, API calls, and authentication. Moreover, clients can subscribe to server-side actions so that they  receive live updates.</p>
<p>React Agent includes offline-support to render optimistic updates and then synchronization on reestablished network connection. It also features time travel debugging.</p>
<p><em>Why use React Agent?</em></p>
<p>The popular conceptualization of state management stores state in two places: data on the client-side and data on the server-side.</p>
<p>To connect these, front-end and back-end developers usually write a lot of code such as HTTP requests, controllers, and routes. It can get complicated.

<p>In contrast, React Agent serves as a communication channel between the client and the server. It abstracts state transfer to make it super easy to interact between the client and server.
